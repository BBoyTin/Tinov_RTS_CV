 This project serves as demonstrational purpose of intermediate programming skills.

The basic idea is to make a RTS(real time strategy) game, but with a programming challenge.
Most 3D RTS games use fixed rotation in its gameplay(like Warcraft FT, SC2). Changing this I wanted to showcase my programming skill, to adept not just to go on tutorials and implement pre made codes.

HOW TO PLAY:
To move the camera use WASD/middle mouse click.
Zoom is mouse scroll while or R/F.
Rotation is Q/E.

Selecting units or buildings is Left Click.
Multi Select: units holding CTRL + Left click.
Box Select: hold alt + Left click and make move the mouse.

Moving Units: selected Units move to right mouse click location.

Fight: everything is automated, if a units is selected it listens to your commend, if not it attacks nearby enemys.

Building: if you have the money amount, you can build it. To Build place the selected building to a position where it is possibile to build(green) to Confirm click SPACE, afterwards move the mouse to your desired rotation and SPACE to confirm.

More Building options arise if you have diferent buildings in the game.

To Make a Unit, click on the Main Building and choose the unit.

For exit press ESC.

MORE NOTES:
This is just a demostrational game made by Tin Trupeljak for showcasing some development challenges and learning/relearning some basic concepts of game development.
The game is by far not finished, there are no sound effects, no game ending, its purpuse is just showing my way of writing code and organising a project. Everything is self made from models to pictures used.

To anyone that takes their time reading this I thank you sincerely.
